%   Goal:  Given a piece of light and temperature observation, find the
%          location estimation
%   Data:  .mat file that contains (see example.mat):
%          1.  time_light: array of time stemps for light observations
%          2.  light:  light observations in lux
%          3.  time_temp: array of time stemps for temperature observations
%          4.  temp: temperature observations in C
%   
%   Notes: - Time stemps are in datetime format
%          - Currently, only light intensity part is realized
